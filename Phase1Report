Subject: Phase 1 - Andersen: QWOP in JavaScript

Phase 1 Project Selection Status Report

Name: George Andersen

College: Robinson

User Identifier: gla23

Director of Studies: Dr. Alan Mycroft

Please complete 1, 2 and 3 below.

1. Please write 100 words on your current project ideas.

The game QWOP puts players in keyboard control of a rag doll athlete, and the aim is to complete the 100m race without falling over. The athlete's 2D limbs are rendered on the screen, and the Q key drives the runner's right thigh forward and left thigh backward, and the W key does the opposite. The O and P keys do the same but for the calves.
I propose to remake QWOP using a Javascript library called Phaser, designed for making games. It has a system of 'sprite's that can be used to render the graphics for each limb, and the rag doll physics can then be made between them.
An extension idea is to build an AI agent that can complete the race, the faster the better.


2. Please list names of potential project supervisors.

Dr. Alastair Beresford


3. Is there any chance that your project will involve any computing resources other than the Computing Service's MCS and software that is already installed there, for example: your own machine, machines in College, special peripherals, imported software packages, special hardware, network access, substantial extra disc space on the MCS.

I will be using my own machine.

If so indicate below what, and what it is needed for.

Windows laptop: Intel Core i7-5500U, 16 GB RAM, 1 TB+8 GB SSHD, AMD R9 4 GB GPU.
Will be used for the research, coding, write up etc.
Will be backing up on GitHub.
