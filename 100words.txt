I propose to remake the game qwop using JavaScript. QWOP has an athelete controlled by the q w o and p keys, and the aim is to complete the 100m race. It turns out to be difficult. To do this I would use a Javascript library designed for making games called Phaser. It has a physics system that I can use to make a body out of joints. I would also add graphics to the joints, add a system to check when you fall over, measure how far you are from the start and show your score/keep high scores etc. An extension goal is to make an ai module with the aim of completing the race quickly.
